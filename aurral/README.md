Self-hosted music discovery and request management for Lidarr with library-aware recommendations, granular monitoring controls, and optional Weekly Flow playlists powered by Soulseek + Navidrome.

---

## What is Aurral?

- Search for artists via MusicBrainz and add them to Lidarr with the monitoring behavior you want
- Browse your existing library in a clean UI
- Discover new artists using recommendations derived from your library and (optionally) Last.fm
- Track requests and download/import progress
- Generate weekly playlists and download the tracks into a separate “Weekly Flow” library

Aurral is designed to be safe for your collection: it does not write into your main music library directly. Library changes go through Lidarr’s API, and Weekly Flow writes into its own directory.

---

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  aurral:
    image: ghcr.io/lklynet/aurral:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=${DL_FOLDER:-./data/downloads}
    volumes:
      - ${DL_FOLDER:-./data/downloads}:/app/downloads
      - ${STORAGE:-./data}:/app/backend/data
```

You can optionally set `DL_FOLDER` and `STORAGE` in a `.env` file next to your compose file. If you leave them unset, Aurral uses `./data/downloads` and `./data`.

Start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open: http://localhost:3001

## Requirements & Recommended Stack

### Required

- Lidarr (reachable from Aurral)
- Last.fm API key (api key required, username needed for scrobbling)
- A MusicBrainz contact email (used for the MusicBrainz User-Agent policy)

### Recommended stack for new users

- Lidarr Nightly
- Tubifarry
- slskd
- Navidrome

### For Weekly Flow

- Navidrome (optional but recommended if you want playlist/library integration)
- A downloads directory mounted into the container (for the Weekly Flow library)

---

## Features

### Discovery

- Daily Discover recommendations based on your library, tags, and trends

### Lidarr Management

- Add artists with granular monitor options (None / All / Future / Missing / Latest / First)
- Add specific albums from release groups
- Library view with quick navigation into artist details
- Request tracking with queue/history awareness

### Weekly Flow (Optional)

Weekly Flow generates playlists from your library and listening context, then downloads tracks via a built-in Soulseek client into a dedicated folder.

- Multiple flows with adjustable mix (Discover / Mix / Trending) and size
- Automatic weekly refresh scheduling
- Optional Navidrome smart playlists and a dedicated “Aurral Weekly Flow” library

## Data, Volumes, and Safety

### Downloads and Weekly Flow library

Mount a downloads folder for Weekly Flow and optional Navidrome integration:

- Container path: `/app/downloads`
- Weekly Flow output: `/app/downloads/aurral-weekly-flow/<flow-id>/<artist>/<album>/<track>`

### A note on your main library

Aurral does not write to your root music folder directly. Changes to your main collection happen via Lidarr (add/monitor/request/import).

---

## Weekly Flow + Navidrome Setup (Optional)

If you want Weekly Flow to appear as a separate library inside Navidrome:

1. In Aurral: Settings → Integrations → Navidrome (URL, username, password)
2. Ensure your compose config maps a host folder into `/app/downloads`
3. Set `DL_FOLDER` once and use it for both `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER` and the `/app/downloads` volume

Example:

- `DL_FOLDER=/data/downloads/tmp`
- Volume: `${DL_FOLDER}:/app/downloads`
- Env: `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=${DL_FOLDER}`

Aurral will:

- Create a Navidrome library pointing to `<DOWNLOAD_FOLDER>/aurral-weekly-flow`
- Write smart playlist files (`.nsp`) into the Weekly Flow library folder

Navidrome should be configured to purge missing tracks so Weekly Flow rotations don’t leave stale entries:

- `ND_SCANNER_PURGEMISSING=always` (or `full`)

---

## Authentication & Reverse Proxy

### Local users (default)

Aurral uses local user accounts created in onboarding. Authentication is HTTP Basic Auth at the API layer. Use HTTPS when exposing it publicly.

### Reset forgotten admin password (terminal)

If you forget your admin password, you can reset it from the terminal:

```bash
npm run auth:reset-admin-password -- --password "new-password"
```

Or generate a random password:

```bash
npm run auth:reset-admin-password -- --generate
```

The `--` after `npm run auth:reset-admin-password` tells npm to pass the remaining flags to the reset script.

### Reverse-proxy auth (OAuth2/OIDC)

If you want SSO, place Aurral behind an auth-aware reverse proxy and forward the authenticated username in a header.

Environment variables:

```bash
AUTH_PROXY_ENABLED=true
AUTH_PROXY_HEADER=X-Forwarded-User
AUTH_PROXY_TRUSTED_IPS=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2
AUTH_PROXY_ADMIN_USERS=alice,bob
AUTH_PROXY_ROLE_HEADER=X-Forwarded-Role
AUTH_PROXY_DEFAULT_ROLE=user
```

### Proxy headers (trust proxy)

If you are behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY` so Aurral interprets `X-Forwarded-*` correctly:

```bash
TRUST_PROXY=true
```

---

## Configuration Reference (Environment Variables)

Most configuration is done in the web UI, but some settings are controlled by environment variables.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `3001` |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Express trust proxy setting (`true`/`false`/number) | `1` |
| `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER` | Weekly Flow root folder path used for Navidrome library creation | `${DL_FOLDER:-./data/downloads}` (in compose example) |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | Run container as this UID/GID (when starting as root) | `1001/1001` |
| `LIDARR_INSECURE` | Allow invalid TLS certificates (`true`/`1`) | unset |
| `LIDARR_TIMEOUT_MS` | Lidarr request timeout | `8000` |
| `SOULSEEK_USERNAME` / `SOULSEEK_PASSWORD` | Optional fixed Soulseek creds | autogenerated if missing |
| `AUTH_PROXY_*` | Reverse-proxy auth options (above) | unset |

## Troubleshooting

- Lidarr connection fails: confirm Lidarr URL is reachable and API key is correct (Settings → Integrations → Lidarr)
- Discovery looks empty: add some artists to Lidarr and/or configure Last.fm; initial discovery refresh can take a bit
- MusicBrainz is slow: MusicBrainz is rate-limited; Aurral respects it and may take longer on first runs
- Weekly Flow does not show in Navidrome: verify `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER` matches your host path mapping and Navidrome purge settings
- Permission errors writing `./data`: set `PUID`/`PGID` to match your host directory ownership
