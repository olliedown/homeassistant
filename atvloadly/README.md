# ATVLoadly for Home Assistant

This custom add-on packages the prebuilt `atvloadly` `v0.4.10` Linux
`amd64` release for Home Assistant.

```

## What it does

- Runs `atvloadly` inside Home Assistant OS / Supervised
- Starts `dbus`, `avahi-daemon`, `usbmuxd2`, and `plumesign` dependencies
- Exposes the UI through Home Assistant Ingress
- Exposes the UI on the LAN through the host network
- Adds a sidebar entry named `ATVLoadly`

## Important notes

- `amd64` only
- Designed for Home Assistant OS / Supervised
- Uses `host_network: true` so mDNS discovery can work
- Default LAN port is `5533`
- `service_port` is configurable, but must not be `58080`
- Sidebar access still works through Home Assistant Ingress
- Ingress rewrites the SPA's code-split asset URLs for nested paths
- The add-on restarts `atvloadly` automatically after an unexpected exit,
  using a short exponential backoff
